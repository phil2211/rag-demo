  "question": "How do I redeem coupon codes on SBB.ch?",
  "answer": "SBB.ch. To use a coupon code when making a purchase online at SBB.ch, enter it directly in the ‘Coupon’ field during payment. The discount will be displayed and deducted immediately. Then complete the purchase as usual. Can I redeem coupon codes for the entire range? Yes. However, in some cases, advertising campaigns or mailings for specific offers restrict the use of coupon codes and only allow them to be redeemed for specific items. Can I redeem several coupons? No, you cannot. You can only redeem one coupon per purchase. If you have more than one coupon and wish to purchase more than one item/offer, we recommend that you purchase each item separately and redeem the relevant coupons. What happens to any remaining amount on the coupon? It is not possible to deduct smaller amounts when redeeming the coupon code, i.e. the remaining amount is forfeited. This means the best option is to use the code for payment when the ticket costs reach or exceed the value of the coupon. Where can I redeem coupons? You can redeem coupon codes at SBB Travel Centres, online at SBB.ch and in the SBB Mobile app. In some cases, advertising campaigns or mailings for specific offers restrict the use of coupon codes and only allow them to be redeemed for specific items. Please check the conditions of the coupon and the item in your shopping basket.",

  "answer": "You can buy a zone upgrade from a ticket machine, online at SBB.ch or in the SBB Mobile app.  Enter the additional route you require. Buy the ticket and present it alongside your Regional Travelcard during the ticket inspection.  Please note the stopping points of your chosen means of transport. In order to buy the right zone upgrade, you need to know where your chosen means of transport (train, s-bahn, bus, tram, etc.) stops. This is because on journeys that go beyond the borders of the network, zone tickets or travelcards are only valid until the last scheduled stop within the zones included in your ticket or travelcard. In this case, buy a ticket from the last stop your chosen means of transport calls at within the zones your travelcard/ticket is valid for. Example: you want to travel from A to D. Your travelcard/ticket is valid, for example, up to and including zone 30.  If your chosen means of transport stops at location C, you should buy a zone upgrade from C to D. If your chosen means of transport stops in A and B, but not in C, you should buy a zone upgrade from B to D. If your chosen means of transport is travelling from A to D without stopping, purchase a standard ticket for the journey from A to D.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              <img src=\"/content/dam/internet/sharedimages/grafiken/infografik-anschlussbillette-en.svg\" class=\"mod_image_figure\" alt=\"Ort A befindet sich innerhalb der Zone 10, Ort B innerhalb der Zone 20, Ort C innerhalb der Zone 30, Ort D befindet sich ausserhalb aller Zonen.\"/>",

  "question": "I have a Regional Travelcard. How do I buy a zone upgrade to a destination within my fare network?",
  "answer": "You can buy a zone upgrade from an SBB ticket machine, online at SBB.ch or in the SBB Mobile app. At SBB ticket machines.  Go to ‘Fare network extension tickets’. Select ‘Extension ticket’ or if available ‘Extension Day Pass’ or ‘Extension multiple-journey ticket’. Select the additional zones you require (tip: refer to the zone map). Select ‘Immediate departure’ or ‘Later departure’. Buy the ticket.  At SBB.ch.  Go to sbb.ch/buying. Select ‘Regional fare networks’. Go to your desired fare network and select the relevant ‘Extension ticket’ option. Enter the additional route you require in the timetable (tip: refer to the zone map and validity). Buy the ticket for the additional route required.  Via SBB Mobile. Store your Regional Travelcard in the SBB Mobile app as follows:  Go to the menu and select ‘Settings’. Go to ‘My Travelcards’. Select ‘Store travelcard manually’ (if not already available). Select ‘Add regional travelcard’.  For connection requests within the same fare network (without the Z-Pass), the travelcard is then automatically credited when you buy a zone upgrade. For this to happen, you must select ‘Zone upgrade’ under ‘Ticket options’ when making your purchase. Your Regional Travelcard will not be taken into account if you buy a “normal” ticket. Tip: most fare networks have a maximum number of zones, and the zone ticket becomes valid for all zones when the maximum number is reached. You may therefore not need the full number of missing zones. Please refer to the rules of your fare network. ZVV as an example: if your existing ZVV ticket or ZVV travelcard plus zone upgrade gives you a total of 8 zones, you are entitled to unlimited travel across the whole ZVV network (all zones) during the validity period of the zone upgrade.                                             Go to the fare networks",

  "question": "Can I calculate the fare for my group journey myself?",
  "answer": "Yes, you can calculate an indicative price. Here is our step-by-step guide for SBB.ch:  Enter your chosen route on SBB.ch and click on ‘search for connection’. You will be shown the connections. Choose one and click on it. Then click on the button ‘Tickets from CHF xx.xx’. If you are not registered, select ‘Purchase as a guest’. On the screen ‘Passengers’, enter a fictional name with the date of birth 01.01.1980 to see the price for adults. Select the discount card: no discount (= full price) or Half Fare Travelcard (choose also for children and young people under 25) and then click on ‘Accept’. Now the price is shown for the discount chosen. Pay attention to the class of travel (you can choose 1st or 2nd class) and change it if necessary. The 2nd class price is given by default. Note the price with and without discount. PLEASE NOTE: do not choose supersaver tickets or Day Passes if available – choose only normal fares! To get an indicative group price per person, multiply the half-fare price and/or the full price by 0.7 (× 0.7 = 30% discount) and round up to the next 20 cents (example: normal fare with Half Fare Travelcard: 29.50; indicative group price: 29.50 × 0.7 = 20.65; rounded up to the next 20 cents = 20.80). Important: to be able to travel at the discounted group fare, at least 10 people must travel together. Passengers with a GA Travelcard count as part of the group, but pay nothing.   No liability is taken for the accuracy of the information, rounding differences may occur. An example calculation. Your group travels from Zürich HB to Fribourg in 2nd class.

  "answer": "The easiest and most convenient way to calculate and/or book your group journey is online from the comfort of your home – avoid having to rush or queue. Ideally you should name one person as group leader for your group journey. This person books the journey and group tickets required (including the reservation). So that we can calculate the price correctly, we need to know the age of the passengers you are travelling with and how many hold a GA or a Half Fare Travelcard. If travellers in the group hold a Modular or Point-to-Point Travelcard covering the whole route, enter these people under ‘GA Travelcard’. If you wish to buy group tickets (including the reservation) online, you / the group leader will need a SwissPass login.  You can also reserve group journeys and buy group tickets at staffed public transport points of sale or by calling the SBB Contact Center on 0848 44 66 88 (CHF 0.08/min.).

  "question": "Is the Dog Pass transferable?",
  "answer": "The Dog Pass is linked with the personal SwissPass of the accompanying person. This means you can take other dogs with you too. However, if other people are taking your dog with them, each companion must purchase their own Dog Pass. For this reason, we have reduced the price (the GA Travelcard for dogs previously cost CHF 805 per year, the Dog Pass now only costs CHF 350).",

  "question": "Can my (e-)scooter come with me on the train?",
  "answer": "Yes. You can take both e-scooters and normal scooters on the train.   Please stow your (electric) scooter in a suitable location on the train and ensure that it does not protrude into the passageway or take up bicycle spaces (e.g. under or between the seats). If your (electric) scooter can be folded, we kindly request that you place it folded up under the seat or in the luggage racks/niches. This ensures that more space is available for luggage, prams etc. Both foldable and unfoldable (electric) scooters are transported free of charge, provided the largest wheel has a diameter of no more than 30cm or less than 12 inches).",

  "answer": "When taking a bike on public transport, it is a requirement that you are able to load and unload it independently and store it in the holder provided. Furthermore, only one bike can be taken per person. Self-service loading of bicycles is only possible if there is sufficient space in the vehicles and it does not hinder other passengers. On modes of transport which require reservation, bicycle transport is only guaranteed if you have bought a bike space reservation in advance (check the online timetable). Escape routes, entrances and exits and access points to the engine driver’s cabin must always be kept clear. Bicycles that are very dirty may be excluded from carriage.",

  "answer": "In older coaches, the bicycle mounts are sometimes not set up for modern mountain bikes with 29-inch wheels and wider tires. Due to the limited space available, it is unfortunately not possible to optimise these bicycle spaces. Therefore, try turning the handlebars, removing a wheel, or maybe even let some air out of the tyre or use a bike lock to attach your bicycle to the hook.

  "question": "What conditions apply to tickets to Europe for exchanges and refunds?",
  "answer": "You can see the conditions and validity for offers before you confirm the booking. Please make sure you check them before you make the purchase.  In many cases, tickets are only valid on the train that you have booked. There are certain offers (mostly saver offers) that cannot be exchanged or refunded – not even in exceptional cases. These conditions are set by the respective railway companies and cannot be changed by SBB.  For this reason, we always recommend that you take out cancellation costs insurance. It is best to purchase this insurance the same day as you purchase your ticket – either separately online as an additional service or at a staffed ticket counter. The insurance can be purchased for a single journey or as an annual policy. Buy Ticket Insurance Europe or annual travel insuranceLink opens in new window.

  "question": "How do I buy group tickets including seat reservations?",
  "answer": "The easiest and most convenient way to calculate and/or book your group journey is online from the comfort of your home – avoid having to rush or queue. Ideally you should name one person as group leader for your group journey. This person books the journey and group tickets required (including the reservation). So that we can calculate the price correctly, we need to know the age of the passengers you are travelling with and how many hold a GA or a Half Fare Travelcard. If travellers in the group hold a Modular or Point-to-Point Travelcard covering the whole route, enter these people under ‘GA Travelcard’. If you wish to buy group tickets (including the reservation) online, you / the group leader will need a SwissPass login.  You can also reserve group journeys and buy group tickets at staffed public transport points of sale or by calling the SBB Contact Center on 0848 44 66 88 (CHF 0.08/min.).

  "question": "Can I calculate the fare for my group journey myself?",
  "answer": "Yes, you can calculate an indicative price. Here is our step-by-step guide for SBB.ch:  Enter your chosen route on SBB.ch and click on ‘search for connection’. You will be shown the connections. Choose one and click on it. Then click on the button ‘Tickets from CHF xx.xx’. If you are not registered, select ‘Purchase as a guest’. On the screen ‘Passengers’, enter a fictional name with the date of birth 01.01.1980 to see the price for adults. Select the discount card: no discount (= full price) or Half Fare Travelcard (choose also for children and young people under 25) and then click on ‘Accept’. Now the price is shown for the discount chosen. Pay attention to the class of travel (you can choose 1st or 2nd class) and change it if necessary. The 2nd class price is given by default. Note the price with and without discount. PLEASE NOTE: do not choose supersaver tickets or Day Passes if available – choose only normal fares! To get an indicative group price per person, multiply the half-fare price and/or the full price by 0.7 (× 0.7 = 30% discount) and round up to the next 20 cents (example: normal fare with Half Fare Travelcard: 29.50; indicative group price: 29.50 × 0.7 = 20.65; rounded up to the next 20 cents = 20.80). Important: to be able to travel at the discounted group fare, at least 10 people must travel together.

There are a few key points to note:  S-Pedelecs (e-bikes with a number plate) cannot be transported on journeys to Germany or Austria. In some countries, the battery cannot be charged during the journey and must be attached to the bike during rail transport. The transport of a spare battery is not permitted in many countries.  Before setting off on an e-bike trip abroad, it’s advisable to find out about the rules of the road in the country you are visiting as they can sometimes differ from those applicable in Switzerland.",

  "answer": "SBB Mobile / SBB Preview.  Start your connection query in the standard timetable or the touch timetable.  Select the connection you require and swipe left to display the tickets available.  Click on ‘Redeem coupon’ below the available tickets.  Then enter your coupon code . The discount will be displayed in your shopping basket and will be automatically deducted from the purchase price. Now continue with the purchase as usual.  Can I redeem coupon codes for the entire range? Yes. However, in some cases, advertising campaigns or mailings for specific offers restrict the use of coupon codes and only allow them to be redeemed for specific items. Can I redeem several coupons? No, you cannot. You can only redeem one coupon per purchase. If you have more than one coupon and wish to purchase more than one item/offer, we recommend that you purchase each item separately and redeem the relevant coupons. What happens to any remaining amount on the coupon? It is not possible to deduct smaller amounts when redeeming the coupon code, i.e. the remaining amount is forfeited. This means the best option is to use the code for payment when the ticket costs reach or exceed the value of the coupon. Where can I redeem coupons? You can redeem coupon codes at SBB Travel Centres, online at SBB.ch and in the SBB Mobile app. You would like to redeem a coupon with a % discount, but this is not possible in the SBB Mobile app. You can currently only redeem % coupons at staffed points of sale and, from mid-February 2024, also on SBB.ch. In some cases, advertising campaigns or mailings for specific offers restrict the use of coupon codes and only allow them to be redeemed for specific items. Please check the conditions of the coupon and the item in your shopping basket.",

If you have a Half Fare/GA Travelcard, this is also a valid form of ID. If you have a travelcard on the SwissPass and have bought a ticket that is linked to it, you can simply show the ticket in the app. The prerequisite for this is that you are logged in with the SwissPass login and were also logged in at the time of purchase. Once you’ve done this, there’s usually no need to show your SwissPass card.   Important: If you can’t get an online connection while your ticket is being checked, you must show your SwissPass or another official form of ID if requested to do so by the inspector.",

  "answer": "It’s quite simple: just start SBB Mobile and check in (by swiping from left to right). Important: You must complete the check-in with EasyRide BEFORE the departure of the means of transport, otherwise the journey is considered a “travel without a valid ticket (RogF)”.  As soon as you have arrived at your destination and alighted from the vehicle, you need to check out (by swiping from right to left). The app records your route and then works out the best ticket for you. The cost of this ticket will be charged automatically to your stored payment method.",

  "question": "What is the difference between SBB EasyRide and Fairtiq?",
  "answer": "EasyRide is based on the technology of our partner, Fairtiq. The straightforward operation, journey recording and price calculation is identical to that of Fairtiq. Common features of all solutions are:   Valid on the entire GA Travelcard network map in Switzerland.  All three solutions determine the price of the journey according to the applicable fare regulations for automatic ticketing.    Advantages of EasyRide compared with the other solutions:   Thanks to the SwissPass login, your travelcards on the SwissPass are included for journeys with EasyRide and the zone upgrade is determined automatically. See below for details of restrictions.  With EasyRide, you can pay for your journeys via a monthly invoice. With EasyRide you can store up to 5 different payment methods: Choose from monthly invoicing, Visa, MasterCard, American Express, PostFinance Card, Twint and Reka.  The Fairtiq app is a purely ticketing app. As EasyRide is integrated into the SBB Mobile app, you benefit from an all-inclusive public transport service:   Easy operability for timetable queries with the touch timetable. Real-time timetable information with change assistance and information about delays. Purchase of Point-to-Point tickets from A to B. Purchase of supersaver tickets and Saver Day Passes. Purchase of tickets for travelling companions or for bicycles and dogs. Display of the digital SwissPass in the app itself.  SBB Mobile is the perfect companion for journeys by public transport in Switzerland. For example, you can buy a supersaver ticket when you are planning journeys in advance, or you can check in with EasyRide for spontaneous trips by public transport then just get on and go – and you have all relevant timetable information to hand at all times.

  "question": "What can I do about location problems on Android smartphones?",
  "answer": "To record your journey correctly, SBB Mobile needs access to your location data. Some versions of Android are configured to prevent SBB Mobile from receiving location data. Therefore, recording and completion may not be possible for some trips. To locate you correctly, your phone also uses Wi-Fi and Bluetooth technology. It is therefore a good idea to keep these technologies activated during your trip (you do not need to be connected to a WLAN network). Have you had a GPS problem? Please complete the following steps before your next trip with EasyRide:  Make sure that SBB Mobile is allowed to use your location. To do so, your smartphone settings should be as follows: Settings > Apps > SBB Mobile > Permissions > Location. Make sure that you allow SBB Mobile to use GPS while using the app. Deactivate the battery saving mode.  Make sure your location settings are set to “High accuracy” / “Exact location”. You can do this as follows: Settings > Additional settings > Privacy > Location > Set to High accuracy or Settings > Connections > Location > Set to High accuracy. Ensure that the exchange of data between your device and SBB Mobile is not negatively influenced by any other app installed (virus scanner etc.) or by battery optimisation.  Please note that if you abort SBB Mobile and EasyRide (when the app is closed in the Task Manager or by swiping it in the list of running apps) immediately after your journey is completed, this can affect the fare paid if SBB Mobile did not have enough time to locate you correctly.",

  "question": "How does the check-out warning work?",
  "answer": "The check-out warning uses the movement sensors in modern smartphones to help you to remember to check out after you have completed your journey. As soon as you are no longer standing or sitting in the vehicle and are walking instead, the app will detect by your movements that you are most likely no longer in the vehicle and it will remind you to check out. For this purpose, you have to activate movement and fitness data on your device and authorise notifications. Please note that we are unfortunately unable to guarantee that the check-out warning will work properly. It is intended as a service to help you remember to check out. We are currently working to improve the reliability of the warning, but it is always your responsibility to make sure that you check out at the right time. Important: Google Pixel, Huawei and Xiaomi smartphones in some cases have an energy saving mode which deactivates the location services required to track your journey. Check your device settings to make sure the SBB Mobile app is a protected app. For example, Huawei Mate 9: System Settings > Power Saving > Protected App > turn the service on for SBB Mobile.",

  "question": "Why can’t I start the check-in process?",
  "answer": "You may have been automatically connected to a public WiFi network that requires you to register before you can use it (e.g. SBB-FREE, PostAuto). The easiest way to avoid this problem is to switch off WiFi on your device or to ignore the WiFi network in question. Please make sure that the WiFi and Bluetooth scanning settings (if available on your device) are activated. You can activate these options in your phone’s settings via ‘Settings’ -> ‘Location’ -> ‘Improve accuracy’ (may vary depending on manufacturer and Android version). For subterranean stops (such as Lucerne, Allmend/Messe, all underground platforms at Zurich main station, Zurich Airport, Geneva Airport and any other underground stations), please check in while you are still on the ground floor as the geolocation may be insufficient underground. Power saving mode and/or battery optimisation on the user device can severely affect the reception of precise location data. This data is essential for recording the journey accurately. Please turn off these settings when using EasyRide.  Location access. iOS. Location access must be set to ‘Always’ to use EasyRide – otherwise it is not possible to record the journey accurately. You can configure this setting in your iPhone’s app settings. For iOS 14 and above, please also activate the “Precise location” option. Android.

  "answer": "This varies from location to location. You can select a location via the search field in the app and obtain information about the applicable tariff and maximum parking duration. Before buying a parking ticket, the costs are calculated for you (at the selected location and for the applicable period). This means you will know the final costs before purchasing the ticket and so can avoid any unpleasant surprises.",

  "answer": "No. You don’t generally have to worry about the difference. When purchasing tickets for the various parking spaces, you’ll just notice a few differences in the booking process.  Tickets for P+Rail parking spaces can be purchased up to 7 days in advance. There is also the option of subsequently extending them. Tickets for Parkingpay parking spaces can only be purchased through a check-in/check-out system. You start the parking process directly and enter an end time. The parking duration cannot be extended. However, you can terminate currently active Parkingpay tickets early at any time. In this case you will only be charged for the actual parking duration.",

The receipt for P+Rail tickets is sent to you directly after purchasing the ticket.  The receipt Parkingpay tickets is only sent to you once the parking ticket has expired (since you can stop the parking procedure early at any time).",

  "answer": "SBB acts as an intermediary for the sale of Parkingpay tickets. The conditions stipulated by Parkingpay (Digitalparking AG) apply. Extract from Digitalparking’s FAQ: “As a rule, the same tariffs apply for the parking meter/cash register. Where explicitly indicated, surcharges are applicable on the parking spaces of specific operators (e.g. Geneva) and/or for the use of certain Parkingpay functions (e.g. individual charges on the means of payment).” The actual costs are clearly indicated for the user at all times in the P+Rail app.                                              pakingpay.ch                         Link opens in new window.",

  "answer": "If a customer is charged according to data usage or has a limited data contract, and would like to avoid automatic generation of mobile data:  iOS: in settings, deactivate “Background App Refresh” for all apps to ensure no unwanted data volumes are used in the background before the FreeSurf app is active. Android: in settings, deactivate “Data Saving” for all apps so that no data volumes are used in the background. If you have a prepaid subscription, an amount may be deducted from the credit balance as soon as mobile services are activated in line with the conditions of the pre-paid subscription. Those registered for FreeSurf can use the app even if they have no credit on their account. Stop the FreeSurf connection before leaving the train and do not wait for the text from the mobile network provider informing you that the free service has been terminated.",

  "question": "Why are international trains equipped with WiFi?",
  "answer": "In contrast to Switzerland, railways abroad often operate on routes that travel through areas with poor coverage. Using WiFi makes sense in this situation because a router pools the existing mobile networks of different providers. The internet connection therefore improves and any gaps in the coverage of individual providers can be balanced out.",

  "question": "Why does SBB not offer WiFi on trains for national longdistance services?",
  "answer": "WiFi on trains cannot be compared to WiFi at home. On trains, data is transmitted via the mobile phone network, while a fibre optic network is used at home, which significantly increases the speed. SBB FreeSurf is built upon the excellent mobile phone coverage in Switzerland and offers customers a faster and smoother internet connection with more bandwidth compared to WiFi on a train. Installing WiFi on a train acts like an additional bottleneck because the signals of many users have to be combined and transmitted to the mobile network using just a few connections.  SBB FreeSurf is the more powerful, technology-independent and cost-effective solution compared to WiFi.",

  "answer": "Bluetooth is one of the weakest electromagnetic sources. The technology SBB uses functions in “low energy mode”. At maximum transmission power, these devices cause about one percent of the radiation exposure of a conventional WLAN router. This means that exposure in close range (right beside the source of radiation) amounts to about 0.5% of the maximum exposure from a mobile phone. The fields can barely be measured more than 2m distance from these devices.",

The rate of data transfer is therefore better on an empty train than a fully occupied one.  However, SBB FreeSurf certainly provides better quality than WiFi on the train would.",

  "answer": "Despite the high and continually increasing number of passengers with an unlimited flat-rate contract, some customers still need free internet access on the train. In collaboration with the mobile phone providers, SBB is covering the needs of this group of customers. A good quality, stable mobile phone connection has become a basic requirement for train passengers. This also has an increasingly strong influence on passengers’ choice of transport modes. SBB is operating on the assumption that SBB FreeSurf is an interim solution. The proportion of customers with an unlimited flat-rate contract is constantly increasing, which is gradually reducing the need for free internet access.",

  "answer": "If you have a pre-paid subscription, an amount may be deducted from the credit balance as soon as mobile services are activated in line with the conditions of the pre-paid subscription. Those registered for FreeSurf can use the app even if they have no credit on their account. There are different solutions available for Salt and Sunrise subscriptions in order to prevent the daily rate from being charged when the SBB FreeSurf is launched. Since Galaxus Mobile and Quickline do not offer pre-paid subscriptions, their customers are not affected. Salt: the customer is charged the daily rate directly. Salt checks in the background whether the SBB FreeSurf app was launched at the same time. If this is the case, the customer receives a remuneration for the daily rate in real time.   Sunrise: to stop Sunrise subscribers from being charged before using FreeSurf, the use of paid mobile data must be blocked before switching mobile data on. The customer can do this using the USSD code *170# and the call button on the keyboard. The customer enters the USSD code #170# to re-enable the use of paid mobile data outside of FreeSurf. Activation and deactivation are confirmed via a text message. Swisscom: For prepaid and postpaid customers, communication between the SBB app and the SBB server is free of charge. Customers who communicate using VPN services (company VPN, Apple Privacy Services, etc.) can only benefit from the free internet usage once they have activated the SBB FreeSurf app. Prepaid customers who are automatically charged the basic tariff can deactivate this at cockpit.swisscom.ch.",

SBB guarantees that they are not tracking your movements and that the location data is deleted straight away. This data is used solely to determine the duration of data use for billing. Customers expressly agree to the use of data for analysing errors before they use the free internet access (same approach as for FreeWiFi). The telecoms providers do not receive any location data for passengers on the train. Data is deleted in accordance with federal regulations.",

  "answer": "With the SBB Inclusive app, people who are blind or visually impaired can receive relevant and location-based timetable information. At the station, the user is shown the next departures and can view the current departures for a given platform. Shortly after boarding an SBB long-distance train with the app open on their phone, the user will be shown which train they have boarded (train number, destination, coach number, class of travel, service zone, next stop).  The app currently works at all Swiss railway stations and on all SBB long-distance trains.

  "answer": "The development team is constantly working on reducing the battery consumption of SBB Inclusive. Battery consumption depends on a range of factors, not all of which relate to the app, however. Using location tracking services, particularly GPS, increases battery usage. However, additional battery usage is kept to a minimum. When the app detects that the smartphone’s location is not changing, the app requests its location less frequently, saving battery power.",

  "question": "Companion Travelcard in combination with other travel discounts.",
  "answer": "In general, the following rule applies: At least one person must be in possession of a valid ticket for travel (ticket, Day Pass, GA Travelcard, point-to-point Travelcard, modular Travelcard, but not Half Fare Travelcard without a ticket or Junior Travelcard without a ticket).  Example A. Companion Travelcard and Half Fare Travelcard = one half-price ticket is sufficient. A person with a disability holding a Companion Travelcards travelling with another person holding a Half Fare Travelcard. The passenger with the disability travels free of charge and their travelling companion with the Half Fare Card buys a half-price ticket. Example B. Companion Travelcard and GA Travelcard = the GA Travelcard is sufficient. A person with a disability holding a Companion Travelcard is travelling with another person holding a GA Travelcard. The passenger with the disability travels free of charge and their travelling companion travels using the GA Travelcard. Example C. Companion Travelcard, Half Fare Travelcard and Junior Travelcard = one half-price ticket is sufficient. One parent holds a Half Fare Travelcard. He is travelling with two children. One child has a Junior Travelcard. The other child uses a wheelchair and holds a Companion Travelcard. The parent with the Half Fare Travelcard buys a half-price ticket, the child in the wheelchair travels free of charge with the Companion Travelcard, the other child travels free of charge with the Junior Travelcard. The Junior Travelcard is only valid with a valid ticket (in this example, the ticket of the parent with the Half Fare Travelcard). Example D. Two Companion Travelcards and one Half Fare Travelcard = one person with a Companion Travelcard needs a valid ticket or travelcard.  Two people with a disability and a Companion Travelcard each are travelling together with one person who has a Half Fare Travelcard. One person with a disability travels for free and the companion with a Half Fare Travelcard purchases a ticket at half price. The second person with a disability needs an additional valid ticket or travelcard. Notice for children up until their 6th birthday: children under 6 years old cannot obtain a Companion Travelcard. This is because they always travel for free anyway. However, those accompanying them must have a valid ticket or travelcard.",

  "question": "I am blind. Can I buy a ticket from a ticket machine?",
  "answer": "Yes. If you are blind or visually impaired, call 0800 11 44 77 to access the SBB ticket machine helpline. Give the person on the telephone the ticket machine number, which is located above the screen in tactile lettering. The SBB ticket machine helpline will help you choose the right ticket and if requested, it will select the required product on the ticket machine for you through remote control. You can then pay for the ticket directly at the ticket machine, where it will also be printed as usual. The SBB ticket machine helpline is open every day, 24 hours a day.",

  "question": "What is the SBB Inclusive app?",
  "answer": "SBB Inclusive is a customer information app that makes travelling on public transport easier, particularly for visually impaired and blind people. The app provides visual and digital customer information for stations and long-distance trains directly in your smartphone and always shows you the information relevant to your location.

    "$oid": "65b2d069cf3899722818a655"
  },
  "question": "How does SBB Inclusive know where I am?",
  "answer": "Two different technologies are used to locate the user and provide them with relevant information:   At the station, GPS signals are used. If the user is at a railway station, the timetable information relevant to that station will be provided.  For coach-specific localisation whilst on board the train, the app uses beacon technology, which works via Bluetooth signals. All data is processed only in the background and SBB neither stores it nor uses it for other purposes.",

  "answer": "The development team is constantly working on reducing the battery consumption of SBB Inclusive. Battery consumption depends on a range of factors, not all of which relate to the app, however. Using location tracking services, particularly GPS, increases battery usage. However, additional battery usage is kept to a minimum. When the app detects that the smartphone’s location is not changing, the app requests its location less frequently, saving battery power.",

  "question": "Where can I stow my luggage on the train?",
  "answer": "In general on trains. The easiest and most secure place to stow your luggage on the move is in the space between and under the seats. That way, you can keep an eye on it at all times. It also means you keep both the walkways and the seats clear. There is a luggage rack above the seats where you can stow smaller items of luggage, such as backpacks and handbags.

There is a luggage rack for stowing items of luggage at the top of the stairs leading to the upper deck. If you are travelling with luggage as a family, you can find multi-functional compartments with space to stow luggage in the lower deck of the family coach (recognisable by its jungle or dragon motifs). On the lower deck of the IC2000, you will find enough space to stow pushchairs, luggage or bikes. Trains with family coaches run mainly on the following InterCity routes: IC1: St. Gallen–Zurich HB–Bern–Geneva Airport IC8: Romanshorn–Zurich HB–Bern–Brig IC6: Basel SBB–Bern–Brig IC61: Basel SBB–Bern–Interlaken Ost IC3: Basel SBB–Zurich HB–Chur     Folding seats on long-distance double-deck trains. In several compartments on long-distance double-deck trains, folding seats are available. They can be found both on the lower deck of the family coach with the playing area and in the compartments with a pushchair signet on the door. Look at the info sticker on the window when you are in the compartment itself. If you are travelling as a family, you will find space for pushchairs and luggage there. IC2000 Modernised IC2000 LD double-decker Tips:  If the multi-functional compartment fills up or is already full, please place your luggage under the seats and in the dedicated luggage racks.

However, Parkingpay car parking spaces can now also be paid for via the P+Rail app. Its scope of application now goes far beyond P+Rail.",

  "question": "How can I detect fraud?",
  "answer": "There are a number of different signs. Most cases of fraud involve asking you to make an advance payment. The following situations are an indication of fraud:  You are surprised that you suddenly have to send money for some reason. You don't know the recipient personally. You are instructed to give certain (false) information if the staff at the point of sale ask you anything. You are pressurised or blackmailed into sending money immediately. Someone you do or don't know e-mails you to ask for an immediate money transfer. You want to take up an excellent offer (an apparent bargain) and have to transfer money in advance. You have won a sum of money or a valuable item even through you haven't entered any prize draws or competitions. Someone asks you to help transfer a very large sum of money. You've been promised a share of the money and you must make your bank account available for the transaction. Due to various expenses, you first have to advance a sum of money that you are told will be returned to you. You've accepted a lucrative job online and receive money in your bank account with the instruction to withdraw it and send it on according to certain instructions. You want to take out a loan with very favourable conditions but must first send money for some reason. You met the recipient on the internet and trust this person. Suddenly, you have to send them a large amount of money. Your pet has run away. Someone contacts you to tell you that they've found it and asks that you send them money for some reason. You want to sell something online. Someone is interested in your offer but first asks that you send them money for some reason. You've received a bank cheque that you must cash before sending the money via Western Union. You want to buy cheap branded products, medication or health tonics from China online and pay via Western Union. You want to buy a pet from abroad online and must pay for it, along with the associated costs, via Western Union. You want to rent a flat (an apparent bargain) and have to send the landlord money via Western Union for some reason.",

  "question": "Why is SBB providing free internet access in the first place?",
  "answer": "Despite the high and continually increasing number of passengers with an unlimited flat-rate contract, some customers still need free internet access on the train. In collaboration with the mobile phone providers, SBB is covering the needs of this group of customers. A good quality, stable mobile phone connection has become a basic requirement for train passengers. This also has an increasingly strong influence on passengers’ choice of transport modes. SBB is operating on the assumption that SBB FreeSurf is an interim solution. The proportion of customers with an unlimited flat-rate contract is constantly increasing, which is gradually reducing the need for free internet access.",

  "question": "Why are international trains equipped with WiFi?",
  "answer": "In contrast to Switzerland, railways abroad often operate on routes that travel through areas with poor coverage. Using WiFi makes sense in this situation because a router pools the existing mobile networks of different providers. The internet connection therefore improves and any gaps in the coverage of individual providers can be balanced out.",

  "answer": "WiFi on trains cannot be compared to WiFi at home. On trains, data is transmitted via the mobile phone network, while a fibre optic network is used at home, which significantly increases the speed. SBB FreeSurf is built upon the excellent mobile phone coverage in Switzerland and offers customers a faster and smoother internet connection with more bandwidth compared to WiFi on a train. Installing WiFi on a train acts like an additional bottleneck because the signals of many users have to be combined and transmitted to the mobile network using just a few connections.  SBB FreeSurf is the more powerful, technology-independent and cost-effective solution compared to WiFi.",

  "answer": "Bluetooth is one of the weakest electromagnetic sources. The technology SBB uses functions in “low energy mode”. At maximum transmission power, these devices cause about one percent of the radiation exposure of a conventional WLAN router. This means that exposure in close range (right beside the source of radiation) amounts to about 0.5% of the maximum exposure from a mobile phone. The fields can barely be measured more than 2m distance from these devices.",

Since Galaxus Mobile and Quickline do not offer pre-paid subscriptions, their customers are not affected. Salt: the customer is charged the daily rate directly. Salt checks in the background whether the SBB FreeSurf app was launched at the same time. If this is the case, the customer receives a remuneration for the daily rate in real time.   Sunrise: to stop Sunrise subscribers from being charged before using FreeSurf, the use of paid mobile data must be blocked before switching mobile data on. The customer can do this using the USSD code *170# and the call button on the keyboard. The customer enters the USSD code #170# to re-enable the use of paid mobile data outside of FreeSurf. Activation and deactivation are confirmed via a text message. Swisscom: For prepaid and postpaid customers, communication between the SBB app and the SBB server is free of charge. Customers who communicate using VPN services (company VPN, Apple Privacy Services, etc.) can only benefit from the free internet usage once they have activated the SBB FreeSurf app. Prepaid customers who are automatically charged the basic tariff can deactivate this at cockpit.swisscom.ch.",

  "question": "Where can I stow my luggage on the train?",
  "answer": "In general on trains. The easiest and most secure place to stow your luggage on the move is in the space between and under the seats. That way, you can keep an eye on it at all times. It also means you keep both the walkways and the seats clear. There is a luggage rack above the seats where you can stow smaller items of luggage, such as backpacks and handbags.

There is a luggage rack for stowing items of luggage at the top of the stairs leading to the upper deck. If you are travelling with luggage as a family, you can find multi-functional compartments with space to stow luggage in the lower deck of the family coach (recognisable by its jungle or dragon motifs). On the lower deck of the IC2000, you will find enough space to stow pushchairs, luggage or bikes. Trains with family coaches run mainly on the following InterCity routes: IC1: St. Gallen–Zurich HB–Bern–Geneva Airport IC8: Romanshorn–Zurich HB–Bern–Brig IC6: Basel SBB–Bern–Brig IC61: Basel SBB–Bern–Interlaken Ost IC3: Basel SBB–Zurich HB–Chur     Folding seats on long-distance double-deck trains. In several compartments on long-distance double-deck trains, folding seats are available. They can be found both on the lower deck of the family coach with the playing area and in the compartments with a pushchair signet on the door. Look at the info sticker on the window when you are in the compartment itself. If you are travelling as a family, you will find space for pushchairs and luggage there. IC2000 Modernised IC2000 LD double-decker Tips:  If the multi-functional compartment fills up or is already full, please place your luggage under the seats and in the dedicated luggage racks.

  "question": "When should I buy a Regional Travelcard and when a Point-to-Point Travelcard and when a Modular Travelcard?",
  "answer": "If the whole of your chosen route lies within one fare network, you will automatically receive a Regional Travelcard.  Point-to-Point Travelcards are only available in regions without a fare network or, when you are travelling beyond the limits of one fare network. If you regularly travel between fare networks or outside a fare network and would like to use local transport, the Modular Travelcard is an ideal solution.  It is worth noting that purchasing a GA Travelcard is the best option beyond a certain distance.",

  "answer": "The Children’s Co-Travelcard is a personal travelcard and is therefore only stored on the child’s own personal SwissPass. Other travelcards: as the child grows older, it is increasingly likely that they will purchase other personal travelcards for travelling independently. A large number of children under 16 already have their own SwissPass card. Additional advantages: the child will also be able to enjoy other advantages. For example, partner services such as ski passes or admission tickets that are deposited on the SwissPass card. Sustainability: the card can be used for five years and can hold numerous different offers. This means that a new plastic card doesn’t need to be produced every year.",

Buy the ticket and present it alongside your Regional Travelcard during the ticket inspection.  Please note the stopping points of your chosen means of transport. In order to buy the right zone upgrade, you need to know where your chosen means of transport (train, s-bahn, bus, tram, etc.) stops. This is because on journeys that go beyond the borders of the network, zone tickets or travelcards are only valid until the last scheduled stop within the zones included in your ticket or travelcard. In this case, buy a ticket from the last stop your chosen means of transport calls at within the zones your travelcard/ticket is valid for. Example: you want to travel from A to D. Your travelcard/ticket is valid, for example, up to and including zone 30.  If your chosen means of transport stops at location C, you should buy a zone upgrade from C to D. If your chosen means of transport stops in A and B, but not in C, you should buy a zone upgrade from B to D. If your chosen means of transport is travelling from A to D without stopping, purchase a standard ticket for the journey from A to D.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              <img src=\"/content/dam/internet/sharedimages/grafiken/infografik-anschlussbillette-en.svg\" class=\"mod_image_figure\" alt=\"Ort A befindet sich innerhalb der Zone 10, Ort B innerhalb der Zone 20, Ort C innerhalb der Zone 30, Ort D befindet sich ausserhalb aller Zonen.\"/>",

  "question": "I have a Regional Travelcard. How do I buy a zone upgrade to a destination within my fare network?",
  "answer": "You can buy a zone upgrade from an SBB ticket machine, online at SBB.ch or in the SBB Mobile app. At SBB ticket machines.  Go to ‘Fare network extension tickets’. Select ‘Extension ticket’ or if available ‘Extension Day Pass’ or ‘Extension multiple-journey ticket’. Select the additional zones you require (tip: refer to the zone map). Select ‘Immediate departure’ or ‘Later departure’. Buy the ticket.  At SBB.ch.  Go to sbb.ch/buying. Select ‘Regional fare networks’. Go to your desired fare network and select the relevant ‘Extension ticket’ option. Enter the additional route you require in the timetable (tip: refer to the zone map and validity). Buy the ticket for the additional route required.  Via SBB Mobile. Store your Regional Travelcard in the SBB Mobile app as follows:  Go to the menu and select ‘Settings’. Go to ‘My Travelcards’. Select ‘Store travelcard manually’ (if not already available). Select ‘Add regional travelcard’.  For connection requests within the same fare network (without the Z-Pass), the travelcard is then automatically credited when you buy a zone upgrade. For this to happen, you must select ‘Zone upgrade’ under ‘Ticket options’ when making your purchase. Your Regional Travelcard will not be taken into account if you buy a “normal” ticket. Tip: most fare networks have a maximum number of zones, and the zone ticket becomes valid for all zones when the maximum number is reached. You may therefore not need the full number of missing zones. Please refer to the rules of your fare network. ZVV as an example: if your existing ZVV ticket or ZVV travelcard plus zone upgrade gives you a total of 8 zones, you are entitled to unlimited travel across the whole ZVV network (all zones) during the validity period of the zone upgrade.

You will be shown the connections. Choose one and click on it. Then click on the button ‘Tickets from CHF xx.xx’. If you are not registered, select ‘Purchase as a guest’. On the screen ‘Passengers’, enter a fictional name with the date of birth 01.01.1980 to see the price for adults. Select the discount card: no discount (= full price) or Half Fare Travelcard (choose also for children and young people under 25) and then click on ‘Accept’. Now the price is shown for the discount chosen. Pay attention to the class of travel (you can choose 1st or 2nd class) and change it if necessary. The 2nd class price is given by default. Note the price with and without discount. PLEASE NOTE: do not choose supersaver tickets or Day Passes if available – choose only normal fares! To get an indicative group price per person, multiply the half-fare price and/or the full price by 0.7 (× 0.7 = 30% discount) and round up to the next 20 cents (example: normal fare with Half Fare Travelcard: 29.50; indicative group price: 29.50 × 0.7 = 20.65; rounded up to the next 20 cents = 20.80). Important: to be able to travel at the discounted group fare, at least 10 people must travel together.

  "answer": "Yes, you have to tell us when ordering your group journey so that a suitable coach can be reserved for you. At the same time, notify the SBB Contact Center Handicap about your journey. Groups that include more than one wheelchair user can only be carried subject to certain conditions. The double-deck trains operated by Long-Distance Services allow groups to travel together (maximum ten people in wheelchairs). On board all other trains, groups may only be able to travel in different compartments or split across several trains, depending on the size of the group.

  "question": "How do I buy group tickets including seat reservations?",
  "answer": "The easiest and most convenient way to calculate and/or book your group journey is online from the comfort of your home – avoid having to rush or queue. Ideally you should name one person as group leader for your group journey. This person books the journey and group tickets required (including the reservation). So that we can calculate the price correctly, we need to know the age of the passengers you are travelling with and how many hold a GA or a Half Fare Travelcard. If travellers in the group hold a Modular or Point-to-Point Travelcard covering the whole route, enter these people under ‘GA Travelcard’. If you wish to buy group tickets (including the reservation) online, you / the group leader will need a SwissPass login.  You can also reserve group journeys and buy group tickets at staffed public transport points of sale or by calling the SBB Contact Center on 0848 44 66 88 (CHF 0.08/min.).

Please contact the office that issued your ticket to request a refund.

  "question": "I can no longer make my journey abroad and would like to have my ticket refunded or exchanged. What can I do?",
  "answer": "You will be shown or informed of the exchange and refund conditions when making the purchase. Refunds are generally only possible up until one day before departure. The deductible shown at the time of purchase will be applied (this can be as high as 100% depending on the train or offer).  If necessary, contact your cancellation insurance provider to have the costs covered for insured reasons. A tip for your next trip: purchase your cancellation costs insurance the same day as your ticket – either separately online as an additional service or at a staffed ticket counter.

For a small number of offers, a partial refund is possible even after a train has departed if a passenger has confirmation of non-use – but usually only up until one month after the travel date at the latest. Please note that the person who was supposed to travel must provide the confirmation of non-use.  Please contact the office that issued your ticket to get a refund. You must have the original ticket to do this. For international tickets purchased online at SBB.ch, please go to a public transport point of sale or call the SBB Contact Center on 0848 44 66 88 (CHF 0.08/min.).

  "question": "What conditions apply to tickets to Europe for exchanges and refunds?",
  "answer": "You can see the conditions and validity for offers before you confirm the booking. Please make sure you check them before you make the purchase.  In many cases, tickets are only valid on the train that you have booked. There are certain offers (mostly saver offers) that cannot be exchanged or refunded – not even in exceptional cases. These conditions are set by the respective railway companies and cannot be changed by SBB.  For this reason, we always recommend that you take out cancellation costs insurance.

  "answer": "Yes, you can calculate an indicative price. Here is our step-by-step guide for SBB.ch:  Enter your chosen route on SBB.ch and click on ‘search for connection’. You will be shown the connections. Choose one and click on it. Then click on the button ‘Tickets from CHF xx.xx’. If you are not registered, select ‘Purchase as a guest’. On the screen ‘Passengers’, enter a fictional name with the date of birth 01.01.1980 to see the price for adults. Select the discount card: no discount (= full price) or Half Fare Travelcard (choose also for children and young people under 25) and then click on ‘Accept’. Now the price is shown for the discount chosen. Pay attention to the class of travel (you can choose 1st or 2nd class) and change it if necessary. The 2nd class price is given by default. Note the price with and without discount. PLEASE NOTE: do not choose supersaver tickets or Day Passes if available – choose only normal fares! To get an indicative group price per person, multiply the half-fare price and/or the full price by 0.7 (× 0.7 = 30% discount) and round up to the next 20 cents (example: normal fare with Half Fare Travelcard: 29.50; indicative group price: 29.50 × 0.7 = 20.65; rounded up to the next 20 cents = 20.80). Important: to be able to travel at the discounted group fare, at least 10 people must travel together. Passengers with a GA Travelcard count as part of the group, but pay nothing.   No liability is taken for the accuracy of the information, rounding differences may occur. An example calculation. Your group travels from Zürich HB to Fribourg in 2nd class.

  "question": "How do I buy group tickets including seat reservations?",
  "answer": "The easiest and most convenient way to calculate and/or book your group journey is online from the comfort of your home – avoid having to rush or queue. Ideally you should name one person as group leader for your group journey. This person books the journey and group tickets required (including the reservation). So that we can calculate the price correctly, we need to know the age of the passengers you are travelling with and how many hold a GA or a Half Fare Travelcard. If travellers in the group hold a Modular or Point-to-Point Travelcard covering the whole route, enter these people under ‘GA Travelcard’. If you wish to buy group tickets (including the reservation) online, you / the group leader will need a SwissPass login.  You can also reserve group journeys and buy group tickets at staffed public transport points of sale or by calling the SBB Contact Center on 0848 44 66 88 (CHF 0.08/min.).

  "question": "What is the SwissPass card?",
  "answer": "The SwissPass card is your key to mobility and leisure. The card is a carrier medium for travelcards such as the Half Fare Travelcard, GA Travelcard, Regional Travelcard or Leisure Travelcard and must be presented during an inspection on public transport. The SwissPass card can also be used as a ski pass at over 80 ski resorts. It opens the Mobility vehicle you have reserved and serves as an access medium when renting bicycles and e-bikes. The new SwissPass cards also enable you to make cashless payments for public transport – uncomplicated and secure.

  "answer": "We recommend that you always take the SwissPass card with you on your journey – for example, in case you have no battery left or you have another technical problem.  The ticket-checking staff can call up your SwissPass details if you show official identification. However, this service is considered a “forgotten travelcard”, for which you pay a fee of CHF 5, as the check takes considerably longer than scanning the SwissPass card.

Door opener: The new SwissPass can be used as an access or identification medium by companies that use the security systems of the Swiss firm Legic.

With this card, children can travel free of charge when accompanied by at least one parent. The accompanying parent must hold a valid ticket from the Swiss Travel System product range. Please note: to receive the Swiss Family Card directly, add the child as a passenger under ‘Add passengers’ when you buy your ticket.

  "question": "What calculations are behind the online timetable display?",
  "answer": "The calculations behind it are highly complex. The following rules influence the search results:  Priority 1: the fastest connection. Priority 2: the most convenient connection (fewest changes). Priority 3: the connection with the best train categories (e.g. an IC has priority over an S-Bahn).  The search results generated by this base calculation can also be influenced by:  personalised searches, such as “carriage of bicycles”, “via field”, “barrier-free travel” etc., which can be set in the advanced search. popular alternative routes: for example, for the Bern – Brig route, both possible routes (1x via Lötschberg tunnel and 1x via the mountain route) are shown in the timetable.  All timetable queries take real time data into account. That means that alternative routes can also be offered.",

  "question": "How is interchange time calculated?",
  "answer": "Since stations and stops differ in size, passengers need different lengths of time to get from A to B. The timetable therefore provides different interchange times for switching from one mode of transport to another for each stop. The standard time is 2 minutes. However, for larger stations, this interchange time is increased, for instance, to 7 minutes for Zürich HB. You can also customise the interchange time on SBB.ch.  Go to ‘Settings’ and click on the circle next to ‘Interchange time’. You can then extend the interchange time by 50% or 100% (twice as long).   Note: You cannot adjust the interchange time in the SBB Mobile / Preview app.",

  "question": "My preferred connection is not shown. Why is that?",
  "answer": "Your preferred connection may not be shown for various reasons:  The interchange time falls short of the required interchange time (or that set in the advanced search). A faster, more convenient connection is available. You have restricted your selection via the advanced search.  You may be able to find your preferred connection by selecting “consider alternative stops at departure point/destination” on SBB.ch. Reason: Construction works can mean that stops are temporarily moved.",

The actual data, however, shows the current service status at any given time: i.e. the actual rail traffic situation – including any disruptions. Both types of data are combined to calculate the best service for you.",

From 3 to 20 minutes: in minute intervals. From 21 to 90 minutes: rounded down to the nearest 5 minutes. From 91 minutes: the newly calculated departure time will be shown.  Delays of unspecified duration: the exact extent of the delay cannot be estimated currently. A more reliable forecast will be added as soon it is possible.",

  "question": "What does an “unspecified delay” mean?",
  "answer": "On Swiss railways, “unspecified delay” means that no prediction can be made as to when a service will continue its journey or stop at or depart from a later station.   Possible reasons for an “unspecified delay”:  A train has a technical problem at the station or on the route which cannot be resolved within a fixed time frame. A problem with the infrastructure cannot be resolved within a fixed time frame, causing suspension of service on the line (e.g. broken rail, damage to the catenary). Natural disasters (e.g. landslide) causing suspension of service on the line.  There is a medical emergency.",

  "question": "How do I know if my connection is affected by engineering works?",
  "answer": "The timetable is updated promptly and in advance with planned changes to travel times due to engineering works. If you receive a message that says the timetable has been updated due to engineering works, you can assume that the relevant changes are visible in the timetable and the connections affected have been updated. Aside from engineering works, disruptions can also lead to unplanned changes at short notice. We therefore recommend that you always check your connection before departure in the online timetable or the SBB Mobile app.",

  "question": "Why can I see the delay on the departure board at the station, but not in the SBB Mobile app or on SBB.ch?",
  "answer": "The online channels retrieve their data via a different path to the departure boards at stations. The data processing and transfer time means that data appear on online channels with a delay of 1-2 minutes.",

  "question": "Why is a certain connection not in the timetable?",
  "answer": "The reasons may be the following:  The train is cancelled, e.g. because of engineering works. Timetable data for international passenger services is not up to date because the timetable data abroad is often not updated as frequently as data from Switzerland.",

  "question": "We are travelling as a group. What must I remember when searching for connections?",
  "answer": "When searching for connections on SBB.ch, you can choose “group travel (Switzerland only)”. This lets you filter for connections which can carry groups as a matter of course.  There are some transport services (e.g. some small buses) which are not able to transport groups. They are then not shown in the selection.                                             Reserve your group journey",

  "question": "How can I activate notifications concerning delays, platform changes or cancellations for a connection?",
  "answer": "If you would like to be informed about changes to your journey, such as platform changes, delays or cancellations, you can subscribe to notifications about the connection via the SBB Mobile app. Swipe your preferred connection to the right.  Alternatively, select your preferred connection, go to the detailed view and click on 'Add to My Trips'. The connections you have subscribed to will be shown in the ‘Trips and Tickets’ section. By subscribing to a journey, you will be kept informed about developments on that route in real time via push notifications. For this to work, please ensure that you have turned on notifications in the app under ‘Settings’ -> ‘Notifications’. You can turn on notifications for information relating to disruption (platform changes, cancellations, delays) and also for information relating to changing vehicles. If you no longer wish to receive information about the journeys you have subscribed to, you can turn off notifications for them at any time. To do so, please return to the ‘Trips and Tickets’ section and delete the relevant connection. You will then receive no further notifications for that connection.",

  "question": "Which stops, addresses and sights are recommended to me?",
  "answer": "The stops, addresses and sights recommended depend on the following criteria:  Number of elements in the information entered corresponding to the stop name. Example: Entry “mün mät” for “Münchenbuchsee, Mätteli”. Corresponding character length.  Example: Entry “Langen Kantonalbank” for “Langenthal, Tell/Kantonalbank”. “Langnau am Albis, Zürcher Kantonalbank” is weighted less because the text is longer. Weighting of traffic volume. If a stop is served by a higher number of journeys, this is listed first. Example: When entering “Zürich”, “Zürich HB” comes up before “Zürich Flughafen” or “Zürich Altstetten”. Sequence of locations (only in the SBB Mobile app). If stops have already been searched once before on the same smartphone, they are listed first in a separate table list as fast choices.",

In an emergency, it is critical that everyone can evacuate quickly. If the aisles of a train are blocked by luggage or passengers, this cannot be guaranteed. Consequently, staff are instructed to limit the occupancy of long-distance trains when passenger volumes are very high.

  "question": "What is an occupancy forecast?",
  "answer": "Occupancy forecasts exist to inform our passengers about the occupancy rate of each train. We offer two main types of occupancy forecasts: class-specific and coach-specific occupancy forecasts. Class-specific. The class-specific occupancy forecast shows how busy individual trains in 1st and 2nd class are statistically likely to be. The data are based on the previous year and are supplemented by regular customer surveys and current (group) reservations.  Coach-specific.  The coach-specific occupancy forecast shows how busy individual coaches are. The data are continuously compared with recently measured passenger frequencies. Additional factors such as holidays and public holidays at the origin and destination and the weather are taken into account.   It is possible that the forecast for the whole train is inconsistent with the coach-specific forecast at a given time. This is because of different forecast methods. We are working on harmonising these two forecasts to make them more consistent in the future.",

  "answer": "SBB long-distance trains can be a maximum of 160% full. That means that a maximum of 60% more people can travel than there are seats available. For trains travelling through the Gotthard Base Tunnel, a maximum occupancy rate of 140% applies. These are guideline values.",

  "answer": "You can find information about the occupancy rate in 1st and 2nd class in the connection overview. In the train formation view, you can find further details about the occupancy rate in individual coaches. The occupancy estimates are based on two different occupancy forecasts: the class-specific and coach-specific occupancy forecast (see “What is an occupancy forecast?”).   Both occupancy predictions are represented by three stick people. These show how high the occupancy rate is. The following scale is used to do so:   1 stick person: low to medium occupancy expected.   2 stick people: high occupancy expected.   3 stick people: very high occupancy expected. The stick people are then coloured red.",

It also means you keep both the walkways and the seats clear. There is a luggage rack above the seats where you can stow smaller items of luggage, such as backpacks and handbags.

There is a luggage rack for stowing items of luggage at the top of the stairs leading to the upper deck. If you are travelling with luggage as a family, you can find multi-functional compartments with space to stow luggage in the lower deck of the family coach (recognisable by its jungle or dragon motifs). On the lower deck of the IC2000, you will find enough space to stow pushchairs, luggage or bikes. Trains with family coaches run mainly on the following InterCity routes: IC1: St. Gallen–Zurich HB–Bern–Geneva Airport IC8: Romanshorn–Zurich HB–Bern–Brig IC6: Basel SBB–Bern–Brig IC61: Basel SBB–Bern–Interlaken Ost IC3: Basel SBB–Zurich HB–Chur     Folding seats on long-distance double-deck trains. In several compartments on long-distance double-deck trains, folding seats are available. They can be found both on the lower deck of the family coach with the playing area and in the compartments with a pushchair signet on the door.

You will receive information about this in good time. The payment deadline cannot be extended.                                               Go to information about payment                         Link opens in new window.

The following deadlines apply:  You will receive a payment reminder with no fee five days after the invoice due date. After a further ten days, you will receive the final warning with a fee of CHF 15. If no payment is made, the travelcard will be blocked on the SwissPass 30 days after the invoice due date.   A blocked travelcard will be reactivated as soon as SBB has received the transferred amount or you can present confirmation of payment. This can be carried out directly at a ticket counter or electronically via the SBB Contact Center. Call us on (tel. 0848 44 66 88 / CHF 0.08/min). If a payment has not been settled within 58 days of the due date, the matter is passed onto the payment collection service.

In regional services, a flat-rate fare is billed in addition to the surcharges. In long-distance services, the actual fare is billed in addition to the surcharges. The surcharges are differentiated depending on whether the ticket is invalid or partially valid. Additionally, the surcharges increase in the 2nd and 3rd instances. The obligation to buy a ticket before travelling applies generally on transport company networks for direct services in Switzerland.",

  "question": "What is a transport contract?",
  "answer": "In most cases, each individual ticket sold is a transport contract. If you are delayed in reaching the final destination shown on your ticket, you can receive as compensation a percentage amount of the price paid for the ticket or transport contract.  If you have several transport contracts, compensation can only be claimed on the transport contract for which the delay occurred. Example: Geneva–London via Paris. There are two tickets for this connection: Geneva–Paris and Paris–London. Both tickets constitute separate transport contracts. Example: Zürich HB–Lübeck Hbf via Basel SBB, Frankfurt (Main) and Hanover. In the majority of cases, this route can be sold as one continuous ticket (i.e. one end-to-end transport contract), even if you have to change trains several times.  Example: Lucerne–Venice via Arth-Goldau. If you purchase this journey from SBB in one single transaction, you will be sold two tickets. However, this is still one continuous transport contract. The connecting ticket from Lucerne to Arth-Goldau is sold to you without VAT and therefore constitutes a continuous transport contract in combination with the EC ticket from Arth-Goldau to Venice.  Example: Bern–Milan. You take the direct EuroCity service from Bern to Milan. You travel to the border station of Domodossola using your GA Travelcard and from Domodossola onwards, you purchase a new ticket via trenitalia.com. You therefore have two national transport contracts and the national passenger rights of the respective railways apply.",

  "question": "What rights do I have if I miss my connection between two trains with different transport contracts?",
  "answer": "Example: Chur–Bellinzona–Milan–Rome. You booked a journey with SBB for the route from Chur via Bellinzona (by Postbus) to Milan (on a EuroCity). You also purchased a journey from Milan to Rome on the Frecciarossa through a third-party provider.  If the Eurocity train arrives late in Milan and you miss your connecting Frecciarossa train to Rome as a result, the ‘Agreement concerning Journey Continuation in respect of International Passenger Traffic by Rail (AJC)’ applies. 16 European rail operators have signed this agreement. It allows international passengers to take the next available train at no extra cost if they miss their connecting train. Trenitalia has signed this agreement. Because you missed your Frecciarossa connection due to the delay with the EC train, Trenitalia will book you onto the next available Frecciarossa train at no extra cost.   It is important that you present a certificate of delay (entitling you to take the next train) to the Trenitalia staff at the counter in Milan. You can obtain this certificate either directly from the train crew on the delayed train or at a Trenitalia customer service desk in Milan. The procedure is the same for all operators who have joined the agreement. You are not entitled to reimbursement for hotel accommodation costs or onward travel by taxi. Here’s a tip for your next trip. Purchase your cancellation costs insurance the same day as your ticket – either separately online as an additional service or at a staffed ticket counter.

  "answer": "SBB is obliged to take passengers to their destination (final destination on the ticket) on the same day – even if they have to change trains several times or take a diversion. However, The Swiss Federal Law on Public Transport contains no provisions with regard to compensation for missing flight connections, theatrical performances, concerts, examinations and the like, or for loss of working hours.

  "answer": "Depending on the nature of the problem, you are entitled to compensation for unsatisfactory quality. Confirmation from the railway staff is always key when establishing unsatisfactory quality.

If a taxi journey makes more sense, this will also be permitted up to a maximum sum of CHF 200. Compensation will only be paid out in exchange for original receipts. If you are affected, you must speak to the train crew or supervisory staff at the station. If you realise early that you will miss your last connection (the last connection may be in the early evening in some locations), you can also speak to staff at the station counter. They will help you to find a taxi or a hotel and can also give you a voucher, which you can then use for the hotel or the taxi.  Equally, shared taxis can be organised in the event of larger incidents.",

  "question": "I had to take a taxi or stay at a hotel abroad due to a delay or a missed connection. Who pays for this?",
  "answer": "The railway company with whom the costs were incurred will reimburse any such additional costs, even if the delay was caused by another railway company.  However, whether you missed the last train of the day while travelling on a continuous transport contract or between different transport contracts is relevant. Here’s a tip for your next trip. Purchase your cancellation costs insurance the same day as your ticket – either separately online as an additional service or at a staffed ticket counter.                                             Travel insurance for your needs                         Link opens in new window.                                       Example of one transport contract. You purchased a train journey for the route Lausanne–Zürich HB–Salzburg–Vienna from SBB. A continuous ticket was issued. This means that you have one single transport contract. The train is delayed in Salzburg and you miss the last connection of the day to Vienna. You are entitled to stay overnight in a hotel. ÖBB will cover the cost since you are stranded in Austria. However, the compensation for the delay will be paid out by SBB. Example of several transport contracts. You purchased a train journey for the route Basel–Milan–Rome from SBB. Two tickets were issued. This means that you have multiple transport contracts. The train is delayed in Milan and you miss the last connection of the day to Rome. Because you missed the connection between two separate transport contracts, you are not entitled to a free night in a hotel. You have to pay for the overnight stay yourself. However, the compensation for the delay will be paid out by SBB. Furthermore, Trenitalia will book you on the earliest possible connection with available seats the following day. Example in the case of a strike. You purchased a journey from Lugano to Amsterdam via Basel and Frankfurt with SBB and you have a continuous transport contract. Unfortunately, there is a strike abroad and you end up stranded in Frankfurt am Main. Deutsche Bahn will only pay for your hotel accommodation if you were not informed about the strike in advance (e.g. via public media sources).",

  "question": "Which routes can I receive compensation for?",
  "answer": "You are entitled to one compensation claim per transport contract. Once you reach the destination station shown on your transport contract with a delay of at least 60 minutes (30 minutes for TGV), you are entitled to compensation.  It does not matter which train or rail transport company caused the delay. The prerequisite for compensation is that you have a ticket for the route you travelled on. Example: Geneva–London via Paris. Two tickets -> two transport contracts. Your TGV Lyria train from Geneva arrives at Paris Gare de Lyon with a delay of 35 minutes. This means that you will miss your connection on the Eurostar to London. Eurostar in Paris Gare du Nord rebooks you on the next possible connection and you arrive in London with an overall delay of 150 minutes. You are entitled to 25% compensation on the Geneva–Paris transport contract.  Example: Zürich HB–Lübeck Hbf via Basel SBB, Frankfurt (Main) and Hanover. One ticket -> one transport contract. You miss your connecting train from Hanover to Hamburg and arrive in Hamburg delayed by 62 minutes. You are entitled to 25% compensation for the Zürich HB–Lübeck transport contract. Example: Lucerne–Venice via Arth-Goldau. Two tickets -> one transport contract. For the journey from Lucerne to Venice, you purchased a connecting ticket without VAT and an EC ticket in one purchase transaction with SBB. Your EC train has now been diverted via Bologna and you arrive in Venice with a delay of 125 minutes. You are entitled to 50% compensation for the Lucerne–Arth-Goldau–Venice transport contract. Example: Bern–Milan. Two tickets -> two transport contracts. You take the direct EuroCity service from Bern to Milan. You travel to the border station of Domodossola using a GA Travelcard and from Domodossola onwards, you purchase a new ticket via trenitalia.com. The EC train arrives in Milan delayed by 45 minutes. You are not entitled to compensation under international passenger rights.",

  "answer": "The check-out warning uses the movement sensors in modern smartphones to help you to remember to check out after you have completed your journey. As soon as you are no longer standing or sitting in the vehicle and are walking instead, the app will detect by your movements that you are most likely no longer in the vehicle and it will remind you to check out. For this purpose, you have to activate movement and fitness data on your device and authorise notifications. Please note that we are unfortunately unable to guarantee that the check-out warning will work properly. It is intended as a service to help you remember to check out. We are currently working to improve the reliability of the warning, but it is always your responsibility to make sure that you check out at the right time. Important: Google Pixel, Huawei and Xiaomi smartphones in some cases have an energy saving mode which deactivates the location services required to track your journey. Check your device settings to make sure the SBB Mobile app is a protected app. For example, Huawei Mate 9: System Settings > Power Saving > Protected App > turn the service on for SBB Mobile.",

  "question": "What can I do about location problems on Android smartphones?",
  "answer": "To record your journey correctly, SBB Mobile needs access to your location data. Some versions of Android are configured to prevent SBB Mobile from receiving location data. Therefore, recording and completion may not be possible for some trips. To locate you correctly, your phone also uses Wi-Fi and Bluetooth technology. It is therefore a good idea to keep these technologies activated during your trip (you do not need to be connected to a WLAN network). Have you had a GPS problem? Please complete the following steps before your next trip with EasyRide:  Make sure that SBB Mobile is allowed to use your location. To do so, your smartphone settings should be as follows: Settings > Apps > SBB Mobile > Permissions > Location. Make sure that you allow SBB Mobile to use GPS while using the app. Deactivate the battery saving mode.  Make sure your location settings are set to “High accuracy” / “Exact location”. You can do this as follows: Settings > Additional settings > Privacy > Location > Set to High accuracy or Settings > Connections > Location > Set to High accuracy. Ensure that the exchange of data between your device and SBB Mobile is not negatively influenced by any other app installed (virus scanner etc.) or by battery optimisation.  Please note that if you abort SBB Mobile and EasyRide (when the app is closed in the Task Manager or by swiping it in the list of running apps) immediately after your journey is completed, this can affect the fare paid if SBB Mobile did not have enough time to locate you correctly.",

Were you unable to present a valid personal travelcard or SwissPass during ticket inspection? Presentation at a later date incurs a fee of CHF 5. You can pay this when you submit the form at the counter or online within 10 days. The fee rises to CHF 30 after 10 days. You will receive the invoice from the SBB Servicecenter Revenue by post.                                             Click here to pay the travelcard/SwissPass fee online",

Comments:  The fee is collected against a bill. The passenger and travel data are recorded on the train. In order to determine the surcharge, cases occurring in regional traffic (RV) and long-distance traffic (FV) are graded in the national SynServ database. In regional services, a flat-rate fare is billed in addition to the surcharges. In long-distance services, the actual fare is billed in addition to the surcharges. The surcharges are differentiated depending on whether the ticket is invalid or partially valid. Additionally, the surcharges increase in the 2nd and 3rd instances. The obligation to buy a ticket before travelling applies generally on transport company networks for direct services in Switzerland.",

Both the “Provisional price” and the “Calculated price” would be CHF 6 for the first two tickets. For the third ticket, however, the “Provisional price” would be CHF 3 once again, but the “Calculated price” would be CHF 0, since the price of the Day Pass would already have been reached.",

For technical reasons, it is not currently possible to show travel information, such as the routes you have travelled or the tickets you have purchased with EasyRide, in the monthly invoice.  Your EasyRide journeys are shown on your statement with the reference “SBB journey / EasyRide”. To verify these items on your statement, we recommend that you compare them with the EasyRide receipt sent to you by e-mail.",

  "question": "Why are there price differences between tickets purchased via SBB.ch or SBB Mobile and EasyRide or other automatic ticketing vendors on the market?",
  "answer": "EasyRide combines the single tickets purchased for travel into cheaper ticket combinations, insofar as this is possible in accordance with the fare provisions applicable to the journey. All automatic ticketing service providers calculate prices on the same basis. If you travel several times in one day, EasyRide uses an algorithm to optimise the calculation of your “day price” based on the routes travelled. However, problems with trip recording due to check-in/check-out or missing or bad location data during or after the trip can lead to price differences with the normal Point-to-Point Ticket on SBB.ch and SBB Mobile. With SBB Mobile and SBB.ch, you purchase a ticket prior to departure for a predefined route with relevant ‘via’ and transfer stations; these fares are fixed. Please note that when you purchase tickets from SBB.ch or SBB Mobile, you have access to supersaver tickets and Saver Day Passes that are not offered in EasyRide.",

  "answer": "We will send you the invoice for your GA or Half Fare Travelcard’s next validity period by e-mail or post two months before the annual automatic renewal. For a GA Travelcard with monthly invoicing, you will receive the invoice every month. You also have the option of receiving your invoices by e-bill. Here’s how it works: We will send the e-bill to the invoice mailbox of your e-banking account. This means that you do not need to scan in the payment slip but can simply check the invoice and approve the payment with a few clicks. To receive e-bills, log into the e-banking platform provided by your financial institution and register with SBB under the E-bill/biller menu option. Please note: If you pay by e-bill, we will not send any further billing information by post or e-mail. We recommend that you subscribe to the reminder service on swisspass.ch. Then you will be reminded of the possible cancellation date for your travelcard by e-mail or text message in good time.",

Comments:  The fee is collected against a bill. The passenger and travel data are recorded on the train. In order to determine the surcharge, cases occurring in regional traffic (RV) and long-distance traffic (FV) are graded in the national SynServ database. In regional services, a flat-rate fare is billed in addition to the surcharges. In long-distance services, the actual fare is billed in addition to the surcharges. The surcharges are differentiated depending on whether the ticket is invalid or partially valid. Additionally, the surcharges increase in the 2nd and 3rd instances. The obligation to buy a ticket before travelling applies generally on transport company networks for direct services in Switzerland.",

  "question": "What is the difference between the customer account on swisspass.ch and the profile on SBB.ch?",
  "answer": "Your customer account on swisspass.ch is the basis for a public transport travelcard such as the Half Fare Travelcard or GA Travelcard. If you buy tickets on SBB.ch or in the SBB Mobile / SBB Preview app, you have the option of logging in with the same access details as for swisspass.ch. This means you have only one login for your public transport services. On SBB.ch, this account is called ‘Profile’. Since you can also buy travelcards (and tickets) for other people, we distinguish between the contracting party and the person travelling. In the SwissPass customer account, you will only be able to find an invoice for your travelcard if you are also the contracting party. For example, if you purchased a GA Travelcard for your son, you will be the contracting party and your son will be the passenger. As the passenger, your son will not be able to find any invoice information regarding the GA Travelcard in his SwissPass customer account. However, you will see this information as you are the contracting party.

  "question": "I have changed my name. My new name is already on my official ID, but the old one is still on my SwissPass. Is my SwissPass still valid despite the change of name?",
  "answer": "Yes, your SwissPass remains valid. However, if you frequently buy tickets in the SBB Mobile app or via SBB.ch, we recommend that you order a replacement card. This makes it easier to check your ticket on the train. If you change your name yourself in your customer account on swisspass.ch (see question ”How do I change my name?”), the replacement card is free of charge. If you apply for a name change at an SBB Travel Centre, the replacement card costs CHF 30.

This is especially helpful with registered house keys and building keys. By comparing the numbers, we can more easily assign your key(s). The exact description of a possible tag is also useful.",

However, this service is considered a “forgotten travelcard”, for which you pay a fee of CHF 5, as the check takes considerably longer than scanning the SwissPass card.

Door opener: The new SwissPass can be used as an access or identification medium by companies that use the security systems of the Swiss firm Legic.

This authentication standard is used globally to simplify the login process for devices and web services (e.g. Facebook, Google, Microsoft Office 365, etc.).",

A new passport photo is required  every five years (until the age of 25); every ten years (from the age of 25 and over).  We will contact you by e-mail or post when we require a new photo from you. You can find all the information about uploading photos on the SwissPass website.

  "question": "What is the SwissPass card?",
  "answer": "The SwissPass card is your key to mobility and leisure. The card is a carrier medium for travelcards such as the Half Fare Travelcard, GA Travelcard, Regional Travelcard or Leisure Travelcard and must be presented during an inspection on public transport. The SwissPass card can also be used as a ski pass at over 80 ski resorts. It opens the Mobility vehicle you have reserved and serves as an access medium when renting bicycles and e-bikes. The new SwissPass cards also enable you to make cashless payments for public transport – uncomplicated and secure.

  "question": "What is SwissPass Mobile and what do I need to be aware of?",
  "answer": "SwissPass Mobile lets you show the public transport travelcards on your SwissPass card conveniently on a digital device (e.g. smartphone or tablet). Various Swiss transport company apps already support SwissPass Mobile, including SBB Mobile and SBB Mobile Preview. To present your SwissPass digitally, you must be signed in to the app with the SwissPass login and have activated SwissPass Mobile. So when there’s a ticket check, you can keep the SwissPass card in your pocket. To use SwissPass Mobile, you need a valid SwissPass card, a linked SwissPass customer account and an app that supports SwissPass Mobile. If you don’t have a customer account yet, please register for one (one-time registration). Go to registration on swisspass.chLink opens in new window.

  "answer": "Protecting your privacy means a lot to us. We respect your identity and privacy and ensure that they are protected and that your personal data is processed in accordance with the applicable laws.  No personal data is stored on your SwissPass. Swiss transport companies cannot locate your SwissPass or use it to track your movements. Any data generated when your SwissPass is inspected on the train will immediately be deleted again after the inspection. Inspection data will therefore not be processed. No unauthorised persons will have access to your data. If your travelcards or partner services are paid for by another person or your company, that person or company will have access to the services they have paid for but not to any other data.",

  "question": "How do I get my SwissPass card?",
  "answer": "SwissPass card with a travelcard. When you buy a public transport travelcard for the first time, you automatically receive the SwissPass card free of charge with your travelcard. You can get your travelcard online or at a staffed public transport point of sale. Your identity will be verified when you make the purchase. When purchasing at a point of sale, you must present a passport or ID card to verify your identity. Please also bring a recent passport photo along with you. When purchasing online, the identity check forms part of the purchasing process. To complete the check, you will need a passport or an ID card and a smartphone with a camera. You will also need a recent, high-quality, digital passport photo. Important: The online purchase with identity check can only be carried out for yourself. If you buy a travelcard for another person, that person needs their own customer account in which the identity check is carried out.

A problem with the infrastructure cannot be resolved within a fixed time frame, causing suspension of service on the line (e.g. broken rail, damage to the catenary).

However, for larger stations, this interchange time is increased, for instance, to 7 minutes for Zürich HB. You can also customise the interchange time on SBB.ch.

  "question": "How can I activate notifications concerning delays, platform changes or cancellations for a connection?",
  "answer": "If you would like to be informed about changes to your journey, such as platform changes, delays or cancellations, you can subscribe to notifications about the connection via the SBB Mobile app. Swipe your preferred connection to the right.  Alternatively, select your preferred connection, go to the detailed view and click on 'Add to My Trips'. The connections you have subscribed to will be shown in the ‘Trips and Tickets’ section. By subscribing to a journey, you will be kept informed about developments on that route in real time via push notifications. For this to work, please ensure that you have turned on notifications in the app under ‘Settings’ -> ‘Notifications’. You can turn on notifications for information relating to disruption (platform changes, cancellations, delays) and also for information relating to changing vehicles. If you no longer wish to receive information about the journeys you have subscribed to, you can turn off notifications for them at any time. To do so, please return to the ‘Trips and Tickets’ section and delete the relevant connection. You will then receive no further notifications for that connection.",

  "question": "How do I know if my connection is affected by engineering works?",
  "answer": "The timetable is updated promptly and in advance with planned changes to travel times due to engineering works. If you receive a message that says the timetable has been updated due to engineering works, you can assume that the relevant changes are visible in the timetable and the connections affected have been updated. Aside from engineering works, disruptions can also lead to unplanned changes at short notice. We therefore recommend that you always check your connection before departure in the online timetable or the SBB Mobile app.",

  "question": "My preferred connection is not shown. Why is that?",
  "answer": "Your preferred connection may not be shown for various reasons:  The interchange time falls short of the required interchange time (or that set in the advanced search). A faster, more convenient connection is available. You have restricted your selection via the advanced search.  You may be able to find your preferred connection by selecting “consider alternative stops at departure point/destination” on SBB.ch. Reason: Construction works can mean that stops are temporarily moved.",

  "question": "We are travelling as a group. What must I remember when searching for connections?",
  "answer": "When searching for connections on SBB.ch, you can choose “group travel (Switzerland only)”. This lets you filter for connections which can carry groups as a matter of course.  There are some transport services (e.g. some small buses) which are not able to transport groups. They are then not shown in the selection.                                             Reserve your group journey",

  "question": "Which stops, addresses and sights are recommended to me?",
  "answer": "The stops, addresses and sights recommended depend on the following criteria:  Number of elements in the information entered corresponding to the stop name. Example: Entry “mün mät” for “Münchenbuchsee, Mätteli”. Corresponding character length.  Example: Entry “Langen Kantonalbank” for “Langenthal, Tell/Kantonalbank”. “Langnau am Albis, Zürcher Kantonalbank” is weighted less because the text is longer. Weighting of traffic volume. If a stop is served by a higher number of journeys, this is listed first. Example: When entering “Zürich”, “Zürich HB” comes up before “Zürich Flughafen” or “Zürich Altstetten”. Sequence of locations (only in the SBB Mobile app). If stops have already been searched once before on the same smartphone, they are listed first in a separate table list as fast choices.",

  "question": "What does ‘information status of the timetable’ mean?",
  "answer": "We regularly update our timetable data so that SBB Mobile and SBB.ch always get you the best services. This takes account of timetable adjustments for building works as well as extra services put on for special events. We are also constantly expanding the scope of the real-time information that we have stored to inform you quickly and reliably in the event of disruptions or platform or formation changes, for example.",

  "question": "What is the difference between target data and actual data?",
  "answer": "The target data reflects the planned status of the timetable – how the timetable should look, in other words. The actual data, however, shows the current service status at any given time: i.e. the actual rail traffic situation – including any disruptions. Both types of data are combined to calculate the best service for you.",

  "question": "What are dividing trains? How can I see if there is a dividing train in my connection?",
  "answer": "A dividing train is a train which divides into two separate train compositions en route. These units serve different destination stations. In short: a train with two destinations. You can identify dividing trains by the symbol of a branching arrow provided in the train information in the SBB Mobile app and on SBB.ch.",

  "answer": "We use occupancy forecasts to guide passengers towards taking trains with lower occupancy rates.

  "question": "Is overcrowding a problem?",
  "answer": "Overcrowding becomes a problem when the safety of passengers and the train crew can no longer be guaranteed in an emergency situation. In an emergency, it is critical that everyone can evacuate quickly. If the aisles of a train are blocked by luggage or passengers, this cannot be guaranteed. Consequently, staff are instructed to limit the occupancy of long-distance trains when passenger volumes are very high. For the Gotthard Base Tunnel, there are increased safety regulations in force.",

  "question": "What is an occupancy forecast?",
  "answer": "Occupancy forecasts exist to inform our passengers about the occupancy rate of each train. We offer two main types of occupancy forecasts: class-specific and coach-specific occupancy forecasts. Class-specific. The class-specific occupancy forecast shows how busy individual trains in 1st and 2nd class are statistically likely to be. The data are based on the previous year and are supplemented by regular customer surveys and current (group) reservations.  Coach-specific.  The coach-specific occupancy forecast shows how busy individual coaches are. The data are continuously compared with recently measured passenger frequencies. Additional factors such as holidays and public holidays at the origin and destination and the weather are taken into account.   It is possible that the forecast for the whole train is inconsistent with the coach-specific forecast at a given time. This is because of different forecast methods. We are working on harmonising these two forecasts to make them more consistent in the future.",

The occupancy estimates are based on two different occupancy forecasts: the class-specific and coach-specific occupancy forecast (see “What is an occupancy forecast?”).   Both occupancy predictions are represented by three stick people. These show how high the occupancy rate is. The following scale is used to do so:   1 stick person: low to medium occupancy expected.   2 stick people: high occupancy expected.   3 stick people: very high occupancy expected. The stick people are then coloured red.",

  "answer": "In general on trains. The easiest and most secure place to stow your luggage on the move is in the space between and under the seats. That way, you can keep an eye on it at all times. It also means you keep both the walkways and the seats clear. There is a luggage rack above the seats where you can stow smaller items of luggage, such as backpacks and handbags.

There is a luggage rack for stowing items of luggage at the top of the stairs leading to the upper deck. If you are travelling with luggage as a family, you can find multi-functional compartments with space to stow luggage in the lower deck of the family coach (recognisable by its jungle or dragon motifs). On the lower deck of the IC2000, you will find enough space to stow pushchairs, luggage or bikes. Trains with family coaches run mainly on the following InterCity routes: IC1: St. Gallen–Zurich HB–Bern–Geneva Airport IC8: Romanshorn–Zurich HB–Bern–Brig IC6: Basel SBB–Bern–Brig IC61: Basel SBB–Bern–Interlaken Ost IC3: Basel SBB–Zurich HB–Chur     Folding seats on long-distance double-deck trains. In several compartments on long-distance double-deck trains, folding seats are available. They can be found both on the lower deck of the family coach with the playing area and in the compartments with a pushchair signet on the door. Look at the info sticker on the window when you are in the compartment itself. If you are travelling as a family, you will find space for pushchairs and luggage there. IC2000 Modernised IC2000 LD double-decker Tips:  If the multi-functional compartment fills up or is already full, please place your luggage under the seats and in the dedicated luggage racks.

Comments:  The fee is collected against a bill. The passenger and travel data are recorded on the train. In order to determine the surcharge, cases occurring in regional traffic (RV) and long-distance traffic (FV) are graded in the national SynServ database. In regional services, a flat-rate fare is billed in addition to the surcharges. In long-distance services, the actual fare is billed in addition to the surcharges. The surcharges are differentiated depending on whether the ticket is invalid or partially valid. Additionally, the surcharges increase in the 2nd and 3rd instances. The obligation to buy a ticket before travelling applies generally on transport company networks for direct services in Switzerland.",

  "question": "What rights do I have if I miss my connection between two trains with different transport contracts?",
  "answer": "Example: Chur–Bellinzona–Milan–Rome. You booked a journey with SBB for the route from Chur via Bellinzona (by Postbus) to Milan (on a EuroCity). You also purchased a journey from Milan to Rome on the Frecciarossa through a third-party provider.  If the Eurocity train arrives late in Milan and you miss your connecting Frecciarossa train to Rome as a result, the ‘Agreement concerning Journey Continuation in respect of International Passenger Traffic by Rail (AJC)’ applies. 16 European rail operators have signed this agreement. It allows international passengers to take the next available train at no extra cost if they miss their connecting train. Trenitalia has signed this agreement. Because you missed your Frecciarossa connection due to the delay with the EC train, Trenitalia will book you onto the next available Frecciarossa train at no extra cost.   It is important that you present a certificate of delay (entitling you to take the next train) to the Trenitalia staff at the counter in Milan. You can obtain this certificate either directly from the train crew on the delayed train or at a Trenitalia customer service desk in Milan. The procedure is the same for all operators who have joined the agreement. You are not entitled to reimbursement for hotel accommodation costs or onward travel by taxi. Here’s a tip for your next trip. Purchase your cancellation costs insurance the same day as your ticket – either separately online as an additional service or at a staffed ticket counter.

  "answer": "If you are unable to reach your destination on the same day due to a cancellation or a delay, you are entitled to overnight accommodation (including breakfast) as well as transport from the station to the hotel and back.  The maximum amount for an overnight stay including breakfast is CHF 200. If a taxi journey makes more sense, this will also be permitted up to a maximum sum of CHF 200. Compensation will only be paid out in exchange for original receipts. If you are affected, you must speak to the train crew or supervisory staff at the station. If you realise early that you will miss your last connection (the last connection may be in the early evening in some locations), you can also speak to staff at the station counter. They will help you to find a taxi or a hotel and can also give you a voucher, which you can then use for the hotel or the taxi.  Equally, shared taxis can be organised in the event of larger incidents.",

  "question": "I had to take a taxi or stay at a hotel abroad due to a delay or a missed connection. Who pays for this?",
  "answer": "The railway company with whom the costs were incurred will reimburse any such additional costs, even if the delay was caused by another railway company.  However, whether you missed the last train of the day while travelling on a continuous transport contract or between different transport contracts is relevant. Here’s a tip for your next trip. Purchase your cancellation costs insurance the same day as your ticket – either separately online as an additional service or at a staffed ticket counter.                                             Travel insurance for your needs                         Link opens in new window.                                       Example of one transport contract. You purchased a train journey for the route Lausanne–Zürich HB–Salzburg–Vienna from SBB. A continuous ticket was issued. This means that you have one single transport contract. The train is delayed in Salzburg and you miss the last connection of the day to Vienna. You are entitled to stay overnight in a hotel. ÖBB will cover the cost since you are stranded in Austria. However, the compensation for the delay will be paid out by SBB. Example of several transport contracts. You purchased a train journey for the route Basel–Milan–Rome from SBB. Two tickets were issued. This means that you have multiple transport contracts. The train is delayed in Milan and you miss the last connection of the day to Rome. Because you missed the connection between two separate transport contracts, you are not entitled to a free night in a hotel. You have to pay for the overnight stay yourself. However, the compensation for the delay will be paid out by SBB. Furthermore, Trenitalia will book you on the earliest possible connection with available seats the following day. Example in the case of a strike. You purchased a journey from Lugano to Amsterdam via Basel and Frankfurt with SBB and you have a continuous transport contract. Unfortunately, there is a strike abroad and you end up stranded in Frankfurt am Main. Deutsche Bahn will only pay for your hotel accommodation if you were not informed about the strike in advance (e.g. via public media sources).",

  "question": "What is a transport contract?",
  "answer": "In most cases, each individual ticket sold is a transport contract. If you are delayed in reaching the final destination shown on your ticket, you can receive as compensation a percentage amount of the price paid for the ticket or transport contract.  If you have several transport contracts, compensation can only be claimed on the transport contract for which the delay occurred. Example: Geneva–London via Paris. There are two tickets for this connection: Geneva–Paris and Paris–London. Both tickets constitute separate transport contracts. Example: Zürich HB–Lübeck Hbf via Basel SBB, Frankfurt (Main) and Hanover. In the majority of cases, this route can be sold as one continuous ticket (i.e. one end-to-end transport contract), even if you have to change trains several times.  Example: Lucerne–Venice via Arth-Goldau. If you purchase this journey from SBB in one single transaction, you will be sold two tickets. However, this is still one continuous transport contract. The connecting ticket from Lucerne to Arth-Goldau is sold to you without VAT and therefore constitutes a continuous transport contract in combination with the EC ticket from Arth-Goldau to Venice.  Example: Bern–Milan. You take the direct EuroCity service from Bern to Milan. You travel to the border station of Domodossola using your GA Travelcard and from Domodossola onwards, you purchase a new ticket via trenitalia.com. You therefore have two national transport contracts and the national passenger rights of the respective railways apply.",

  "question": "Which routes can I receive compensation for?",
  "answer": "You are entitled to one compensation claim per transport contract. Once you reach the destination station shown on your transport contract with a delay of at least 60 minutes (30 minutes for TGV), you are entitled to compensation.  It does not matter which train or rail transport company caused the delay. The prerequisite for compensation is that you have a ticket for the route you travelled on. Example: Geneva–London via Paris. Two tickets -> two transport contracts. Your TGV Lyria train from Geneva arrives at Paris Gare de Lyon with a delay of 35 minutes. This means that you will miss your connection on the Eurostar to London. Eurostar in Paris Gare du Nord rebooks you on the next possible connection and you arrive in London with an overall delay of 150 minutes. You are entitled to 25% compensation on the Geneva–Paris transport contract.  Example: Zürich HB–Lübeck Hbf via Basel SBB, Frankfurt (Main) and Hanover. One ticket -> one transport contract. You miss your connecting train from Hanover to Hamburg and arrive in Hamburg delayed by 62 minutes. You are entitled to 25% compensation for the Zürich HB–Lübeck transport contract. Example: Lucerne–Venice via Arth-Goldau. Two tickets -> one transport contract. For the journey from Lucerne to Venice, you purchased a connecting ticket without VAT and an EC ticket in one purchase transaction with SBB. Your EC train has now been diverted via Bologna and you arrive in Venice with a delay of 125 minutes. You are entitled to 50% compensation for the Lucerne–Arth-Goldau–Venice transport contract. Example: Bern–Milan. Two tickets -> two transport contracts. You take the direct EuroCity service from Bern to Milan. You travel to the border station of Domodossola using a GA Travelcard and from Domodossola onwards, you purchase a new ticket via trenitalia.com. The EC train arrives in Milan delayed by 45 minutes.

  "question": "What can I do about location problems on Android smartphones?",
  "answer": "To record your journey correctly, SBB Mobile needs access to your location data. Some versions of Android are configured to prevent SBB Mobile from receiving location data. Therefore, recording and completion may not be possible for some trips. To locate you correctly, your phone also uses Wi-Fi and Bluetooth technology. It is therefore a good idea to keep these technologies activated during your trip (you do not need to be connected to a WLAN network). Have you had a GPS problem? Please complete the following steps before your next trip with EasyRide:  Make sure that SBB Mobile is allowed to use your location. To do so, your smartphone settings should be as follows: Settings > Apps > SBB Mobile > Permissions > Location. Make sure that you allow SBB Mobile to use GPS while using the app. Deactivate the battery saving mode.  Make sure your location settings are set to “High accuracy” / “Exact location”. You can do this as follows: Settings > Additional settings > Privacy > Location > Set to High accuracy or Settings > Connections > Location > Set to High accuracy. Ensure that the exchange of data between your device and SBB Mobile is not negatively influenced by any other app installed (virus scanner etc.) or by battery optimisation.  Please note that if you abort SBB Mobile and EasyRide (when the app is closed in the Task Manager or by swiping it in the list of running apps) immediately after your journey is completed, this can affect the fare paid if SBB Mobile did not have enough time to locate you correctly.",

  "question": "How does the check-out warning work?",
  "answer": "The check-out warning uses the movement sensors in modern smartphones to help you to remember to check out after you have completed your journey. As soon as you are no longer standing or sitting in the vehicle and are walking instead, the app will detect by your movements that you are most likely no longer in the vehicle and it will remind you to check out. For this purpose, you have to activate movement and fitness data on your device and authorise notifications. Please note that we are unfortunately unable to guarantee that the check-out warning will work properly. It is intended as a service to help you remember to check out. We are currently working to improve the reliability of the warning, but it is always your responsibility to make sure that you check out at the right time. Important: Google Pixel, Huawei and Xiaomi smartphones in some cases have an energy saving mode which deactivates the location services required to track your journey. Check your device settings to make sure the SBB Mobile app is a protected app. For example, Huawei Mate 9: System Settings > Power Saving > Protected App > turn the service on for SBB Mobile.",

Comments:  The fee is collected against a bill. The passenger and travel data are recorded on the train. In order to determine the surcharge, cases occurring in regional traffic (RV) and long-distance traffic (FV) are graded in the national SynServ database. In regional services, a flat-rate fare is billed in addition to the surcharges. In long-distance services, the actual fare is billed in addition to the surcharges. The surcharges are differentiated depending on whether the ticket is invalid or partially valid. Additionally, the surcharges increase in the 2nd and 3rd instances. The obligation to buy a ticket before travelling applies generally on transport company networks for direct services in Switzerland.",

If, for example, you have made five individual journeys over the course of one day and a Day Pass would have worked out cheaper for you, we will only charge you the price of a Day Pass. A final statement showing all the journeys completed, tickets issued and debits will be sent to the e-mail account registered in your SwissPass login at the latest two days after the journey.

  "answer": "EasyRide is a service from our technology partner Fairtiq. Monthly invoices are sent from our separate partner CembraPay. For technical reasons, it is not currently possible to show travel information, such as the routes you have travelled or the tickets you have purchased with EasyRide, in the monthly invoice.  Your EasyRide journeys are shown on your statement with the reference “SBB journey / EasyRide”. To verify these items on your statement, we recommend that you compare them with the EasyRide receipt sent to you by e-mail.",

  "question": "What’s the difference between the “Provisional price” and the “Calculated price”?",
  "answer": "These two prices are generally identical. However, if you make several journeys on the same day, you may benefit from a special price. Example: you use EasyRide three times in one day in the same zone. The zone ticket costs CHF 3 per journey while the Day Pass for the zone is CHF 6. Both the “Provisional price” and the “Calculated price” would be CHF 6 for the first two tickets. For the third ticket, however, the “Provisional price” would be CHF 3 once again, but the “Calculated price” would be CHF 0, since the price of the Day Pass would already have been reached.",

  "question": "Why are there price differences between tickets purchased via SBB.ch or SBB Mobile and EasyRide or other automatic ticketing vendors on the market?",
  "answer": "EasyRide combines the single tickets purchased for travel into cheaper ticket combinations, insofar as this is possible in accordance with the fare provisions applicable to the journey. All automatic ticketing service providers calculate prices on the same basis. If you travel several times in one day, EasyRide uses an algorithm to optimise the calculation of your “day price” based on the routes travelled. However, problems with trip recording due to check-in/check-out or missing or bad location data during or after the trip can lead to price differences with the normal Point-to-Point Ticket on SBB.ch and SBB Mobile. With SBB Mobile and SBB.ch, you purchase a ticket prior to departure for a predefined route with relevant ‘via’ and transfer stations; these fares are fixed. Please note that when you purchase tickets from SBB.ch or SBB Mobile, you have access to supersaver tickets and Saver Day Passes that are not offered in EasyRide.",

  "answer": "We will send you the invoice for your GA or Half Fare Travelcard’s next validity period by e-mail or post two months before the annual automatic renewal. For a GA Travelcard with monthly invoicing, you will receive the invoice every month. You also have the option of receiving your invoices by e-bill. Here’s how it works: We will send the e-bill to the invoice mailbox of your e-banking account. This means that you do not need to scan in the payment slip but can simply check the invoice and approve the payment with a few clicks. To receive e-bills, log into the e-banking platform provided by your financial institution and register with SBB under the E-bill/biller menu option. Please note: If you pay by e-bill, we will not send any further billing information by post or e-mail. We recommend that you subscribe to the reminder service on swisspass.ch. Then you will be reminded of the possible cancellation date for your travelcard by e-mail or text message in good time.",

Comments:  The fee is collected against a bill. The passenger and travel data are recorded on the train. In order to determine the surcharge, cases occurring in regional traffic (RV) and long-distance traffic (FV) are graded in the national SynServ database. In regional services, a flat-rate fare is billed in addition to the surcharges. In long-distance services, the actual fare is billed in addition to the surcharges. The surcharges are differentiated depending on whether the ticket is invalid or partially valid. Additionally, the surcharges increase in the 2nd and 3rd instances. The obligation to buy a ticket before travelling applies generally on transport company networks for direct services in Switzerland.",

  "question": "What is the difference between the customer account on swisspass.ch and the profile on SBB.ch?",
  "answer": "Your customer account on swisspass.ch is the basis for a public transport travelcard such as the Half Fare Travelcard or GA Travelcard. If you buy tickets on SBB.ch or in the SBB Mobile / SBB Preview app, you have the option of logging in with the same access details as for swisspass.ch. This means you have only one login for your public transport services. On SBB.ch, this account is called ‘Profile’. Since you can also buy travelcards (and tickets) for other people, we distinguish between the contracting party and the person travelling. In the SwissPass customer account, you will only be able to find an invoice for your travelcard if you are also the contracting party. For example, if you purchased a GA Travelcard for your son, you will be the contracting party and your son will be the passenger. As the passenger, your son will not be able to find any invoice information regarding the GA Travelcard in his SwissPass customer account. However, you will see this information as you are the contracting party.

  "question": "What is the difference between the contracting party and the person travelling?",
  "answer": "In most cases, the contracting party and the person travelling are the same person because you buy a travelcard (or a ticket) for yourself. However, if you purchase a travelcard (or a ticket) for another person (e.g. a child, your grandfather or anyone else), you are then the contracting party and the other person is the person travelling. This has an impact on what contracting partners and persons travelling see in their respective SwissPass customer accounts.

Select “Customer data” in the top right under your initials. Then, under “Personal details”, click on “Change” and “Start identity check”. You will automatically receive a SwissPass card with your new name. The card is free of charge and will be sent to you by post. Go to your customer dataLink opens in new window. At a public transport point of sale (subject to charge): Have your name changed at a Travel Centre. Please bring a valid official ID with you. The SwissPass replacement card costs CHF 30 and will be sent to you by post.",

  "question": "I have changed my name. My new name is already on my official ID, but the old one is still on my SwissPass. Is my SwissPass still valid despite the change of name?",
  "answer": "Yes, your SwissPass remains valid. However, if you frequently buy tickets in the SBB Mobile app or via SBB.ch, we recommend that you order a replacement card. This makes it easier to check your ticket on the train. If you change your name yourself in your customer account on swisspass.ch (see question ”How do I change my name?”), the replacement card is free of charge. If you apply for a name change at an SBB Travel Centre, the replacement card costs CHF 30.
